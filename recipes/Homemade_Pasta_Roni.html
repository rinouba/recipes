      Call it a childhood craving, dorm room gourmet, or simply a grocery store
      pantry staple, but homemade angel hair pasta with herbs is just as tasty
      and fast to make! There's no denying the simplicity.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>3 ounces angel hair pasta</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring chicken broth in a saucepan to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook
        angel hair pasta in the boiling broth, stirring occasionally, until
        tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Drain pasta, reserving 1/4 cup of chicken broth.</li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add garlic and cook
        until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in Italian seasoning, reserved
        1/4 cup chicken broth, and whipping cream. Add Parmesan cheese and stir
        until melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in angel hair pasta; toss to coat. Garnish with freshly minced
        parsley.
